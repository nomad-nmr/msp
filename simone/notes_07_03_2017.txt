- outline
	- fine to fill some sections, but outline is what i am looking for
- second part of the experiment with three factors
	- based on user data only
	- based on group data only
	- based on all data (from all users and groups)

	- make permutations before hand (e.g. user is going to run 15 cases, randomise the cases before the experiment is run. [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, ....])
- I would suggest to get as many people as possible from 5-6 groups
- Second part of experiment, ask people for written feedback after experiment
- You can record time to run experiment using code
- print on an A4 paper a message like "experiment running. to take part email me <email@st-andrews.ac.uk>"
- Try to send drafts of dissertation to Simon and Simone maybe once a week. Drafts do not have to be perfect
- version the data you collect
